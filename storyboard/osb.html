<hr />
<p>If you've used the beatmap editor, you've probably noticed that osu! uses a
tool which is commonly called the &quot;design tab&quot; that can be used to create
storyboards directly in your editor. This is the most popular technique and
probably, the easiest way to create osu! storyboards. This is why I think, this
is the most powerful tool to learn storyboard basics and fundamentals before
jumping into more complicated frameworks such as osbx or storybrew.</p>
<p>Some people might think using the design tab is a bad solution to get into the
vaste world of storyboarding, but I don't totally agree with that opinion
since, for people that aren't comfortable with programming, jumping directly
into a complex programming environment using libraries and advanced coding
techniques can be a really difficult challenge. Now that it has been said,
let's get into this important chapter together!</p>
<h3 id="introduction"><a class="header" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h3>
<hr />
<p>Before getting started into the main subject of this chapter, let's dig a bit
into the back-end structure of a storyboard. By that I mean, what exactly,
defines a storyboard.</p>
<p>A storyboard, is simply a bunch of <strong>images</strong> (commonly called <strong>Sprite</strong>) that
have a collection of <strong>parameters</strong>.</p>
<p>Parameters are defined by the <strong>type</strong> of the parameter (the most common ones
are <code>Move</code>, <code>Scale</code> and <code>Fade</code>), the <strong>timestamps</strong> at which the parameters
takes effect (expressed in milliseconds) and the <strong>values</strong> given to the
parameter.</p>
<p>Let's take a simple example: let's say we have a sprite and we want to give it
a parameter. We want to create a <code>Fade</code> parameter (that's the <em>type</em> of the
parameter). The values to the given <code>Fade</code> parameter range between 0.0 (0%) and
1.0 (100%). We could, for instance, create this parameter:</p>
<p><code>At 1000ms of the osu! beatmap: fade my sprite with the value 0.6</code></p>
<p>But then, how does one create an animation? That's actually pretty simple: in
storyboarding, you never assign a values using more than 2 <strong>keyframes</strong>. Which
means an animation is from a point A to a point B, there is not calcultation or
whatever thing between 3 points like a bezier would be doing for an osu! curved
slider. It's only from <strong>point A to point B</strong>, period. The process that is
calcultating a value between 2 points is called a <strong>tween</strong>, this is a very
common way to create animation in general, in After Effect, or many game user
interfaces. So how does the tweening process work?</p>
<pre><code>[Value 1]                   [Value 2]
[Time  1] ---- [TWEEN] ---- [Time  2]
[       ]                   [       ]
</code></pre>
<p>A tween then is just something that is behing calculated automatically
<strong>between</strong> 2 values.</p>
<p>We can assign few different types of parameters to a sprite, every of them are
literally easy to understand, except for the &quot;Vector Scale&quot; which is basically
a scale on two different axis.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/x97TCFe.png" alt="Sprite parameters" /></p>
<p>In osu!, a parameter is called &quot;Transformation&quot;, but we just use the word
parameters in the community because it sounds more convinient programmatically.</p>
<p>It's also important to note that a tween only happen between 2 values of the
same type, for example you can't tween from a type A that is not the same than
a type B. If the first value type is a <code>Fade</code>, the second one is a <code>Fade</code>.</p>
<p>Every sprite of a storyboard has a <strong>layer</strong> group assigned to it. Each layer
group is rendered differently while playing the map. There are two main layer
groups that are rendered the same way, it's the <code>Background</code>, and the
<code>Foreground</code>. Those two are the &quot;default&quot; layer groups that simply render a
sprite without anything else involved. The <code>Fail</code> and <code>Pass</code> group are used to
show something depending on the player performance, if he fails a section, the
<code>Fail</code> layer is going to show, otherwise, the <code>Pass</code> will be shown. The last
layer group is the <code>Overlay</code>, this one is kinda specific, it does work like the
<code>Foreground</code> except, every object will be displayed on top of the osu! map
hitobjects.</p>
<p>The order of the sprites in the layer groups is very important because this is
what decide if a sprite is on top of another. The lower a sprite is in the
hierarchy, the nearest it's gonna be from the user.</p>

<h3 id="the-design-tab"><a class="header" href="#the-design-tab">The design tab</a></h3>
<hr />
<p>If you ever used a tool like Premiere Pro, After Effect or even Flash, you
might find some similarities with osu!'s built-in storyboard editor. This tool
will help you a lot understand the core principles of osu! storyboarding. It
uses what is called a &quot;<strong>timeline</strong>&quot; that is offering you a clear and easy to
use way to assign actions to Sprites.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6BWgf8Y.png" alt="Example of the design tab timeline" /></p>
<p>To add a new sprite into your storyboard, click on the &quot;Sprite Library&quot; button,
it'll show up a menu which contains every image file existing in your beatmap
folder. You can then, pick up any sprite you want from that menu to add it into
your storyboard!</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/AxV1GLu.png" alt="Sprite library menu" /></p>
<p>Once it's added, the sprite will only be shown at the exact time you were at
when you've opened the Sprite Library menu. If you scroll with your mouse,
you'll notice that the sprite will disappear. It's because when you add a
sprite in your storyboard, it simply create a <code>Move</code> parameter at the time you
were at.</p>
<p>If you save your beatmap, you'll see a .osb file appearing in the
beatmap folder, this is where every data of the storyboard is stored, it works
similary to a .osu file.</p>
<p>In that file, you can see that some lines are already present. The most
important ones are the Sprite one and the line that follows starting with a
&quot;M&quot;. You can now realize that, in fact, osu! have created a new Sprite, and
give it the &quot;M&quot; parameter which is a Move, that is place on a certain timestamp
(140580 in my case).</p>
<p>That is helping us realize that the .osb file is simply a script that describes
our storyboard.</p>
<p><em>Example of what you can find in your .osb file so far</em></p>
<pre><code>Sprite,Foreground,Centre,&quot;bg.png&quot;,320,240
 M,0,140580,,320,240
</code></pre>
<p>Now, if we want to animate that new Sprite, let's head back to the osu! editor
and see how does that work. First of all, select the sprite in the layer group
menu (when a sprite is selected you see its text in bold), then, select the
&quot;Move&quot; transformation from the left side menu of the editor. Finally scroll a
bit further from the first position of the sprite, and then, click on the &quot;+&quot;
button located under the timeline. You'll notice a green segment being
generated, this segment is what we've called &quot;tween&quot; just right before.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/VqUXtMB.png" alt="" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>But we've placed another Move parameter, why does my Sprite doesn't do
anything???</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You're right! We've placed another movement keyframe, but it's not moving,
because by just clicking on the &quot;+&quot; button, it simply add a keyframe with the
same value of the previous one. Which means if our first keyframe position was
(320x,240y), the new keyframe added will be exactly that same value. But don't
worry, we can now change that value to make our Sprite move like we want! To do
so, use the right arrow (aside of the + and - buttons) until you're placed on
the last keyframe, then just click, and drag the image at the position you
want. If you now scoll a bit, your Sprite should move from the first keyframe
to the second one, congratulations!</p>
<p>You can of course choose to remove the tween between two keyframes. That can be
sometime useful if you don't want osu! to calculate an animation from a time A
to B and simply want it to apply a parameter to your sprite at a specific time,
and snap to its value without tweening from the previous value.</p>
<p>I suggest you now to test out each different parameters that can be used in the
design tab to understand how all of these a working. Also, be careful of always
moving your Sprite with a drag while your editor state is <strong>paused</strong>,
otherwise, the editor will place a LOT of keyframes and it can be a pain to
Ctrl-Z them sometimes.</p>
<p>All of that being said, you should have an overview on how does the design tab
work for the very basics. I'll talk about easings and origins in details in the
next chapter, but now, let's look a look at how does the .osb language work.</p>
<h3 id="the-osb-language"><a class="header" href="#the-osb-language">The .osb language</a></h3>
<hr />
<p>The .osb file is what the .osu file is for beatmaps, but for storyboards. It
contains all the data of the <strong>mapset</strong> storyboard. You've been propably
wondering why I'm talking about the mapset. It's because there are multiple
ways to generate data for an osu! storyboard. The first one --that is the most
common-- is generating the mapset storyboard data which is ONLY stored in the
.osb file of the beatmap folder. The other possibility is using the .osu file
to add your storyboard data into it, this is what we call &quot;difficulty&quot;
storyboard.</p>
<p>Most of the time, we're using the difficulty storyboard data to generate
difficulty-specific storyboards (when you have sprites on osu! hitobject for
example). I don't recommend you using the difficulty-specific for now, because
it may cause you some troubles and bad optimization issues (duplicated
storyboard data), but it's an important concept to understand.</p>
<p>Let's make a quick analysis of a fresh created .osb file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">[Events]
//Background and Video events
//Storyboard Layer 0 (Background)
//Storyboard Layer 1 (Fail)
//Storyboard Layer 2 (Pass)
//Storyboard Layer 3 (Foreground)
//Storyboard Layer 4 (Overlay)
//Storyboard Sound Samples
</code></pre>
<p>Nothing crazy is happening there, an osb file simply have to define an [Events]
and then you'll have few comments used for layer groups, those are
automatically generated by osu!. You'll notice that there are two more layers
that we didn't discuss about early on:</p>
<p><strong>Background &amp; Video events</strong>: A group that is used to handle base background
information &amp; video if there is one. Most of the time this is setup in the .osu
difficulty file.</p>
<p><strong>Sound samples</strong>: This group is used for storyboard hitound samples, because
you can use hitsound in your storyboards, but I personnally don't recommend
this for various reasons.</p>
<p>Enough of analysis, let's now create something! Creating a sprite and make it
move only using the .osb file is a good start point to understand properly how
does that work. First of all, let's open up our recent osb file from the last
beatmap, it should look like that:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">[Events]
//Background and Video events
//Storyboard Layer 0 (Background)
//Storyboard Layer 1 (Fail)
//Storyboard Layer 2 (Pass)
//Storyboard Layer 3 (Foreground)
Sprite,Foreground,Centre,&quot;bg.png&quot;,320,240
 M,0,140580,,320,240
//Storyboard Layer 4 (Overlay)
//Storyboard Sound Samples
</code></pre>
<p>We can remove the M line to only have
<code>Sprite,Foreground,Centre,&quot;bg.png&quot;,320,240</code> under the Foreground layer group,
and let's analyze that specific line. Here is how osu! read that:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">[Sprite | Foreground | Centre | &quot;bg.png&quot; |    320     |     240   ]
[ Type  | LayerGroup | Origin |   Path   | Position_X | Position_Y]
</code></pre>
<p>It's pretty easy right? Nothing really different from the design tab. But what
.osb files usefulness really is, is that you can specify very precise values
and avoid a lot of headaches while you are using a lot of Sprites in your
storyboard. It's, in my opinion, easier to make something clean using the .osb
file rather than using the design tab.</p>
<p>Okay, let's try to add something to that sprite now!</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">Sprite,Foreground,Centre,&quot;bg.png&quot;,320,240
_F,0,0,10000,0,1
</code></pre>
<p><em>the underscore is a space character, it's just an easier way for you to read
the code</em></p>
<p>The line we've added is a <code>Fade</code> parameter, you're now probably familiar with
it now that we've used the design tab a bit. What we learn here is that every
parameters from the design tab options is usable in the .osb file naturally.
What does that line do then? It's simply add a <code>Fade</code> to our sprite that start
at 0ms with a value of 0 and end at 10000ms with a value of 1. Here's how osu!
reads that line:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">[    F     |    0   |     0     |  10000  |      0     |     1   ]
[Parameter | Easing | StartTime | EndTime | StartValue | EndValue]
</code></pre>
<p>Still following? I understand it might be a bit overwhelming to understand at a
first glance, but fear not! You will quickly get used to this way of creating
storyboards! You can find a list of every parameters and values in the
<a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Storyboard_Scripting/Commands#basic-commands">official
osu!wiki</a>
(I recommend you reading that wiki aside of this one to understand concepts)</p>
<p>Now, you can try to create some cool little animations using the .osb language
and the osu!wiki. Before moving to the next chapter, I'd like to give you some
little exercices to get used to the basics of storyboarding, you can use .osb
and design tab, use what fit the most with your needs and preferences!</p>

<hr />
<ol>
<li>
<p>Generate 3 Sprites, One should move, the second one should fade out, and the
last one scale down to 0, the 3 sprites have to do their actions from 0ms to
10000ms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generate a sprite, make it slowly move from bottom to top, and add a fade
out to it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generate another background behind your map, make it scale properly to fit
the playfield, and move slowly from the start of the map to the end. The
background should also fade in at the beginning, and fade out at the end.</p>
</li>
</ol>
