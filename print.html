<p>Welcome to the osbx wiki!</p>
<p>In this wiki, you will find plenty of resources to learn about the featured
tool <code>osbx</code>. If you are not yet comfortable with the <code>.osb</code> file format,
there is also documentation about storyboarding in general. You can find
everything you need on the left sidebar.</p>
<p><strong>Warning</strong>: This wiki is still work in progress, if you're
interested in contributing, please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/osbx/wiki/">GitHub

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="getting-started"><a class="header" href="#getting-started">Getting started</a></h1>
<p>Let's get started on your osbx journey! In this category, we'll talk about
<code>osbx</code>.</p>
<p>We will learn how to set up a workspace and how you can use this tool. You
will also learn about the concept of components and plugins and understand
how they work together to make your storyboard scalable. Finally, we will
help you create your very first plugin using osbx and see how you can join
the community and collaborate!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="osbx-installation"><a class="header" href="#osbx-installation">osbx Installation</a></h1>
<p>The osbx core generator is a npm package that can be found on
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/osbx">npmJS</a> but the installation process is
made easier using the osbx-cli npm package, which is a basic command line
interface to help you creating your projects and manage them.</p>
<h2 id="requirements"><a class="header" href="#requirements">Requirements</a></h2>
<p>You're gonna need few dependencies to run an osbx project properly:</p>
<h3 id="basic-dependencies"><a class="header" href="#basic-dependencies">Basic dependencies</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">NodeJS and NPM</a> (both comes together)</li>
<li><a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a></li>
<li>A text editor such as VSCode (recommended), Vim, Emacs, SublimeText ...</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="npm-dependencies"><a class="header" href="#npm-dependencies">NPM dependencies</a></h3>
<p>Once you have installed node and npm, you will have to run the next command to
run the project properly:</p>
<pre><code>$ npm i -g osbx-cli nodemon ts-node
</code></pre>
<p>osbx-cli is the CLI that I talked about.</p>
<p>Nodemon is a npm package to run local server that watch for your file
modifications.</p>
<p>ts-node is the TypeScript-to-JavaScript compiler for nodeJS, this is required
to execute your project into node.</p>
<h2 id="installing-with-osbx-cli"><a class="header" href="#installing-with-osbx-cli">Installing with osbx-cli</a></h2>
<p>Once every dependency is correctly installed, you can try to run the following
command</p>
<pre><code>$ osbx create-project
</code></pre>
<p>This will ask you some information to complete to generate your new osbx
project! Answer the questions, also choose generate base component if you're
not familiar with osbx yet. Your command prompt should look like this after
filling up all the information:</p>
<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/lVKC8s7.png" /></center>
<p>The last question will ask you to choose the beatmap folder, copy the direct
link to your beatmap folder where you want to generate your storyboard.</p>
<p>After his work done, you should be able to see your new osbx project folder
created, congratulations!</p>
<p>You can now, open the folder with <code>cd [project-name]</code> and run the command
<code>npm run storyboard</code>. If everything is fine, you should see a message like:</p>
<pre><code>### STARTING NEW BUILD ###
🟢 [Main]: Component successfully built!

Storyboard successfully generated! [11ms] 🎍
</code></pre>
<p>If it's the case, you're now ready to create your first storyboard using
<code>osbx</code>!</p>
<h2 id="manual-installation-not-recommended"><a class="header" href="#manual-installation-not-recommended">Manual installation (not recommended)</a></h2>
<p>If you want to create an osbx project with your own project structure, it's
possible by just installing the osbx package in a new created folder. You can
create your own plugin &amp; component class containing the following structure:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">// PLUGIN FILE
import Plugin from &quot;osbx/lib/core/plugin&quot;;

class osbx_core extends Plugin {
    plugin_function() {
        // ...
    }
}

export default new osbx_core;
export { osbx_core }
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-ts">// COMPONENT FILE
import Component from &quot;osbx/lib/core/component&quot;;

export default class Main extends Component {
    public Generate() {
        // ...
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>You will see later what plugins and components are, for now, just copy the
content of these files.</p>
<p>With these both files, you can add a main.ts file which will use the function
Generator::MakeStoryboard() and load a component array in the parameters.</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">// main.ts file
import package_file = require(&quot;./package.json&quot;);
import Generator from &quot;osbx/lib/core/generator&quot;;
import Globals from &quot;osbx/lib/core/globals&quot;;

// Import your components and plugins here
import component from &quot;./components/component&quot;;
import plugin from &quot;./plugins/plugin&quot;

let start_time = new Date();

let globals = Globals.getInstance();
globals.config = package_file.config;
globals.start_time = start_time;

const COMPONENTS = [
    new component([plugin])
];

Generator.MakeStoryboard(COMPONENTS, package_file.config.beatmap_path, start_time);
</code></pre>
<p>You're now ready to get started!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="osbx-concepts"><a class="header" href="#osbx-concepts">osbx concepts</a></h1>
<p>Here is the documentation about the core concepts and technical specifications
of osbx. I highly recommend following the <a href="https://wiki.osbx.org/storyboard/">.osb file
format</a> guide to understand this page with
more ease, the osb guide is focusing on the .osb file format to help you
understand how does osu storyboards works. Consider this as a &quot;global&quot; tutorial
page.</p>
<p>Once you're comfortable with the .osb file format, you can get started on your
osbx journey.</p>
<h2 id="introduction-to-osbx-a-bit-of-history"><a class="header" href="#introduction-to-osbx-a-bit-of-history">Introduction to osbx (A bit of history)</a></h2>
<p>So, you just installed osbx on your computer and now you are ready to create
the next revolutionary storyboard osu! has ever seen? Before that, I'd like to
explain you the core idea behind osbx and its history. I've been personally
using <a href="https://github.com/Damnae/storybrew">storybrew</a> since the beginning of
my storyboarding career, it's a powerful tool to create storyboards and
probably better than osbx at its current state. I loved using it for making my
projects, but for me it's time to move forward and create my own tool to
generate storyboards.</p>
<p>There is 2 main reasons why I decided to create my own tool:</p>
<ul>
<li>On April 2021 I've entirely switched my computer Operating systems from
Windows to Linux, and unfortunately, storybrew cannot running on Linux, even
with Wine.</li>
<li>Despite all of the great projects made with storybrew, I always felt like it
was missing a huge thing: the forced structure of it made the creation of
bigger projects very difficult to maintain, and the collaboration with other
people can become quickly very messy and not comfortable to work with. As an
example, Alexithymia, the project I made with -Tochi was a real challenge to
maintain and not break because all the code involved and not properly
structured.</li>
</ul>
<p>With these 2 ideas in mind, my objective was fixed. My requirements are a tool
that can run on every platforms and that is focusing his conception on
collaboration and scalability. Which unlocked a third point that I have
discussed with Asperatus (Zerss) for a while: creating a package manager to
share scripts for osbx, that could work like npm, allowing people to publish
their modules with others, and also download modules made by the community. I
believe in this idea because it brings up great links between the community.</p>
<p>Enough of chit chat, let's now jump into the core of osbx.</p>
<h2 id="global-structure"><a class="header" href="#global-structure">Global structure</a></h2>
<p>Here is the main pattern behind osbx's generation system. The generator is what
you use in the storyboard.ts file, it simply takes a group of components, and
render them in the .osb file. A component is just something that store all the
sprites data that comes from the plugins.</p>

</center>
<blockquote>
<p>Why this specific structure?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This structure as been made with the idea of collaboration in mind and a way to
have sort of &quot;extensibility&quot; for storyboard projects, for instance, you can
program a background effect in a plugin, and then use in in any component you
want in the future, and a component can be simply a section of the map. So if
you create a Background effect, you can add it to the Introduction, but also in
the Main lead of the song without any problems.</p>
<p>And for the collaborative side, you can for example, code your plugin on your
side, then merge it with your mate that developed another plugin into your
common components. Since the storyboard is splitted into different parts, there
can't be conflicts while merging your project with your collaborator's.</p>

<h2 id="osu-design-tab-and-the-osb-file-structure"><a class="header" href="#osu-design-tab-and-the-osb-file-structure">osu! design tab and the .osb file structure</a></h2>
<hr />
<p>If you've used the beatmap editor, you've probably noticed that osu! uses a
tool which is commonly called the &quot;design tab&quot; that can be used to create
storyboards directly in your editor. This is the most popular technique and
probably, the easiest way to create osu! storyboards. This is why I think, this
is the most powerful tool to learn storyboard basics and fundamentals before
jumping into more complicated frameworks such as osbx or storybrew.</p>
<p>Some people might think using the design tab is a bad solution to get into the
vaste world of storyboarding, but I don't totally agree with that opinion
since, for people that aren't comfortable with programming, jumping directly
into a complex programming environment using libraries and advanced coding
techniques can be a really difficult challenge. Now that it has been said,
let's get into this important chapter together!</p>
<h3 id="introduction"><a class="header" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h3>
<hr />
<p>Before getting started into the main subject of this chapter, let's dig a bit
into the back-end structure of a storyboard. By that I mean, what exactly,
defines a storyboard.</p>
<p>A storyboard, is simply a bunch of <strong>images</strong> (commonly called <strong>Sprite</strong>) that
have a collection of <strong>parameters</strong>.</p>
<p>Parameters are defined by the <strong>type</strong> of the parameter (the most common ones
are <code>Move</code>, <code>Scale</code> and <code>Fade</code>), the <strong>timestamps</strong> at which the parameters
takes effect (expressed in milliseconds) and the <strong>values</strong> given to the
parameter.</p>
<p>Let's take a simple example: let's say we have a sprite and we want to give it
a parameter. We want to create a <code>Fade</code> parameter (that's the <em>type</em> of the
parameter). The values to the given <code>Fade</code> parameter range between 0.0 (0%) and
1.0 (100%). We could, for instance, create this parameter:</p>
<p><code>At 1000ms of the osu! beatmap: fade my sprite with the value 0.6</code></p>
<p>But then, how does one create an animation? That's actually pretty simple: in
storyboarding, you never assign a values using more than 2 <strong>keyframes</strong>. Which
means an animation is from a point A to a point B, there is not calcultation or
whatever thing between 3 points like a bezier would be doing for an osu! curved
slider. It's only from <strong>point A to point B</strong>, period. The process that is
calcultating a value between 2 points is called a <strong>tween</strong>, this is a very
common way to create animation in general, in After Effect, or many game user
interfaces. So how does the tweening process work?</p>
<pre><code>[Value 1]                   [Value 2]
[Time  1] ---- [TWEEN] ---- [Time  2]
[       ]                   [       ]
</code></pre>
<p>A tween then is just something that is behing calculated automatically
<strong>between</strong> 2 values.</p>
<p>We can assign few different types of parameters to a sprite, every of them are
literally easy to understand, except for the &quot;Vector Scale&quot; which is basically
a scale on two different axis.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/x97TCFe.png" alt="Sprite parameters" /></p>
<p>In osu!, a parameter is called &quot;Transformation&quot;, but we just use the word
parameters in the community because it sounds more convinient programmatically.</p>
<p>It's also important to note that a tween only happen between 2 values of the
same type, for example you can't tween from a type A that is not the same than
a type B. If the first value type is a <code>Fade</code>, the second one is a <code>Fade</code>.</p>
<p>Every sprite of a storyboard has a <strong>layer</strong> group assigned to it. Each layer
group is rendered differently while playing the map. There are two main layer
groups that are rendered the same way, it's the <code>Background</code>, and the
<code>Foreground</code>. Those two are the &quot;default&quot; layer groups that simply render a
sprite without anything else involved. The <code>Fail</code> and <code>Pass</code> group are used to
show something depending on the player performance, if he fails a section, the
<code>Fail</code> layer is going to show, otherwise, the <code>Pass</code> will be shown. The last
layer group is the <code>Overlay</code>, this one is kinda specific, it does work like the
<code>Foreground</code> except, every object will be displayed on top of the osu! map
hitobjects.</p>
<p>The order of the sprites in the layer groups is very important because this is
what decide if a sprite is on top of another. The lower a sprite is in the
hierarchy, the nearest it's gonna be from the user.</p>

<h3 id="the-design-tab"><a class="header" href="#the-design-tab">The design tab</a></h3>
<hr />
<p>If you ever used a tool like Premiere Pro, After Effect or even Flash, you
might find some similarities with osu!'s built-in storyboard editor. This tool
will help you a lot understand the core principles of osu! storyboarding. It
uses what is called a &quot;<strong>timeline</strong>&quot; that is offering you a clear and easy to
use way to assign actions to Sprites.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6BWgf8Y.png" alt="Example of the design tab timeline" /></p>
<p>To add a new sprite into your storyboard, click on the &quot;Sprite Library&quot; button,
it'll show up a menu which contains every image file existing in your beatmap
folder. You can then, pick up any sprite you want from that menu to add it into
your storyboard!</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/AxV1GLu.png" alt="Sprite library menu" /></p>
<p>Once it's added, the sprite will only be shown at the exact time you were at
when you've opened the Sprite Library menu. If you scroll with your mouse,
you'll notice that the sprite will disappear. It's because when you add a
sprite in your storyboard, it simply create a <code>Move</code> parameter at the time you
were at.</p>
<p>If you save your beatmap, you'll see a .osb file appearing in the
beatmap folder, this is where every data of the storyboard is stored, it works
similary to a .osu file.</p>
<p>In that file, you can see that some lines are already present. The most
important ones are the Sprite one and the line that follows starting with a
&quot;M&quot;. You can now realize that, in fact, osu! have created a new Sprite, and
give it the &quot;M&quot; parameter which is a Move, that is place on a certain timestamp
(140580 in my case).</p>
<p>That is helping us realize that the .osb file is simply a script that describes
our storyboard.</p>
<p><em>Example of what you can find in your .osb file so far</em></p>
<pre><code>Sprite,Foreground,Centre,&quot;bg.png&quot;,320,240
 M,0,140580,,320,240
</code></pre>
<p>Now, if we want to animate that new Sprite, let's head back to the osu! editor
and see how does that work. First of all, select the sprite in the layer group
menu (when a sprite is selected you see its text in bold), then, select the
&quot;Move&quot; transformation from the left side menu of the editor. Finally scroll a
bit further from the first position of the sprite, and then, click on the &quot;+&quot;
button located under the timeline. You'll notice a green segment being
generated, this segment is what we've called &quot;tween&quot; just right before.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/VqUXtMB.png" alt="" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>But we've placed another Move parameter, why does my Sprite doesn't do
anything???</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You're right! We've placed another movement keyframe, but it's not moving,
because by just clicking on the &quot;+&quot; button, it simply add a keyframe with the
same value of the previous one. Which means if our first keyframe position was
(320x,240y), the new keyframe added will be exactly that same value. But don't
worry, we can now change that value to make our Sprite move like we want! To do
so, use the right arrow (aside of the + and - buttons) until you're placed on
the last keyframe, then just click, and drag the image at the position you
want. If you now scoll a bit, your Sprite should move from the first keyframe
to the second one, congratulations!</p>
<p>You can of course choose to remove the tween between two keyframes. That can be
sometime useful if you don't want osu! to calculate an animation from a time A
to B and simply want it to apply a parameter to your sprite at a specific time,
and snap to its value without tweening from the previous value.</p>
<p>I suggest you now to test out each different parameters that can be used in the
design tab to understand how all of these a working. Also, be careful of always
moving your Sprite with a drag while your editor state is <strong>paused</strong>,
otherwise, the editor will place a LOT of keyframes and it can be a pain to
Ctrl-Z them sometimes.</p>
<p>All of that being said, you should have an overview on how does the design tab
work for the very basics. I'll talk about easings and origins in details in the
next chapter, but now, let's look a look at how does the .osb language work.</p>
<h3 id="the-osb-language"><a class="header" href="#the-osb-language">The .osb language</a></h3>
<hr />
<p>The .osb file is what the .osu file is for beatmaps, but for storyboards. It
contains all the data of the <strong>mapset</strong> storyboard. You've been propably
wondering why I'm talking about the mapset. It's because there are multiple
ways to generate data for an osu! storyboard. The first one --that is the most
common-- is generating the mapset storyboard data which is ONLY stored in the
.osb file of the beatmap folder. The other possibility is using the .osu file
to add your storyboard data into it, this is what we call &quot;difficulty&quot;
storyboard.</p>
<p>Most of the time, we're using the difficulty storyboard data to generate
difficulty-specific storyboards (when you have sprites on osu! hitobject for
example). I don't recommend you using the difficulty-specific for now, because
it may cause you some troubles and bad optimization issues (duplicated
storyboard data), but it's an important concept to understand.</p>
<p>Let's make a quick analysis of a fresh created .osb file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">[Events]
//Background and Video events
//Storyboard Layer 0 (Background)
//Storyboard Layer 1 (Fail)
//Storyboard Layer 2 (Pass)
//Storyboard Layer 3 (Foreground)
//Storyboard Layer 4 (Overlay)
//Storyboard Sound Samples
</code></pre>
<p>Nothing crazy is happening there, an osb file simply have to define an [Events]
and then you'll have few comments used for layer groups, those are
automatically generated by osu!. You'll notice that there are two more layers
that we didn't discuss about early on:</p>
<p><strong>Background &amp; Video events</strong>: A group that is used to handle base background
information &amp; video if there is one. Most of the time this is setup in the .osu
difficulty file.</p>
<p><strong>Sound samples</strong>: This group is used for storyboard hitound samples, because
you can use hitsound in your storyboards, but I personnally don't recommend
this for various reasons.</p>
<p>Enough of analysis, let's now create something! Creating a sprite and make it
move only using the .osb file is a good start point to understand properly how
does that work. First of all, let's open up our recent osb file from the last
beatmap, it should look like that:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">[Events]
//Background and Video events
//Storyboard Layer 0 (Background)
//Storyboard Layer 1 (Fail)
//Storyboard Layer 2 (Pass)
//Storyboard Layer 3 (Foreground)
Sprite,Foreground,Centre,&quot;bg.png&quot;,320,240
 M,0,140580,,320,240
//Storyboard Layer 4 (Overlay)
//Storyboard Sound Samples
</code></pre>
<p>We can remove the M line to only have
<code>Sprite,Foreground,Centre,&quot;bg.png&quot;,320,240</code> under the Foreground layer group,
and let's analyze that specific line. Here is how osu! read that:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">[Sprite | Foreground | Centre | &quot;bg.png&quot; |    320     |     240   ]
[ Type  | LayerGroup | Origin |   Path   | Position_X | Position_Y]
</code></pre>
<p>It's pretty easy right? Nothing really different from the design tab. But what
.osb files usefulness really is, is that you can specify very precise values
and avoid a lot of headaches while you are using a lot of Sprites in your
storyboard. It's, in my opinion, easier to make something clean using the .osb
file rather than using the design tab.</p>
<p>Okay, let's try to add something to that sprite now!</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">Sprite,Foreground,Centre,&quot;bg.png&quot;,320,240
_F,0,0,10000,0,1
</code></pre>
<p><em>the underscore is a space character, it's just an easier way for you to read
the code</em></p>
<p>The line we've added is a <code>Fade</code> parameter, you're now probably familiar with
it now that we've used the design tab a bit. What we learn here is that every
parameters from the design tab options is usable in the .osb file naturally.
What does that line do then? It's simply add a <code>Fade</code> to our sprite that start
at 0ms with a value of 0 and end at 10000ms with a value of 1. Here's how osu!
reads that line:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">[    F     |    0   |     0     |  10000  |      0     |     1   ]
[Parameter | Easing | StartTime | EndTime | StartValue | EndValue]
</code></pre>
<p>Still following? I understand it might be a bit overwhelming to understand at a
first glance, but fear not! You will quickly get used to this way of creating
storyboards! You can find a list of every parameters and values in the
<a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Storyboard_Scripting/Commands#basic-commands">official
osu!wiki</a>
(I recommend you reading that wiki aside of this one to understand concepts)</p>
<p>Now, you can try to create some cool little animations using the .osb language
and the osu!wiki. Before moving to the next chapter, I'd like to give you some
little exercices to get used to the basics of storyboarding, you can use .osb
and design tab, use what fit the most with your needs and preferences!</p>
<h3 id="exercices"><a class="header" href="#exercices">Exercices</a></h3>
<hr />
<ol>
<li>
<p>Generate 3 Sprites, One should move, the second one should fade out, and the
last one scale down to 0, the 3 sprites have to do their actions from 0ms to
10000ms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generate a sprite, make it slowly move from bottom to top, and add a fade
out to it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generate another background behind your map, make it scale properly to fit
the playfield, and move slowly from the start of the map to the end. The
background should also fade in at the beginning, and fade out at the end.</p>

<hr />
<p>In this chapter I'll go a bit deeper into the osb file structure by presenting
you the &quot;hidden&quot; advanced techniques of storyboarding which can be really
helpful improving your projects and make them more enjoyable to watch.</p>
<p>I'm gonna first explain your the concepts of <strong>Easings</strong>, <strong>Animations</strong>,
<strong>Additive</strong> and <strong>Loops</strong> which are four pillars of the advanced storyboarding
world.</p>
<h3 id="easings"><a class="header" href="#easings">Easings</a></h3>
<hr />
<p>Before jumping into that subject, I highly recommend you watching this video
explaining the concept of easing.</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="425"
src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AlXEzbhfZJM" title="YouTube video player"
frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write;
encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Pretty cool right? So what we are learning in that video is that linear
movements doesn't feel natural and does not offer a proper emphasis to our
animations, luckily, osu! implements all of the common easings to
storyboarding! This means you can apply the general easings to a specific
parameter: this is what the first value of a sprite parameter does. Don't
remember which one?</p>
<pre><code>M,0,0,1000,320,240,300,240
  Ʌ
  ╰─ This one!
</code></pre>
<p>So if we change that <code>0</code> value, to the value of the easing needed, this gonna
change the animation Tween method from linear to whatever easing you want. Here
the list of all the easings osu uses with their ID:</p>
<pre><code>0 - Linear: no easing
1 - Easing Out: the changes happen fast at first, but then slow down toward the end
2 - Easing In: the changes happen slowly at first, but then speed up toward the end
3 - Quad In
4 - Quad Out
5 - Quad In/Out
6 - Cubic In
7 - Cubic Out
8 - Cubic In/Out
9 - Quart In
10 - Quart Out
11 - Quart In/Out
12 - Quint In
13 - Quint Out
14 - Quint In/Out
15 - Sine In
16 - Sine Out
17 - Sine In/Out
18 - Expo In
19 - Expo Out
20 - Expo In/Out
21 - Circ In
22 - Circ Out
23 - Circ In/Out
24 - Elastic In
25 - Elastic Out
26 - ElasticHalf Out
27 - ElasticQuarter Out
28 - Elastic In/Out
29 - Back In
30 - Back Out
31 - Back In/Out
32 - Bounce In
33 - Bounce Out
34 - Bounce In/Out
</code></pre>
<p><em>Source: osu!wiki</em></p>
<p>I recommend you trying out every value to see how it affects a sprite animation
process, if you also want to visualize every easings more easily before using
them, you can refer to that great website <a href="https://easings.net">easings.net</a>
which list every easings an how they affect the intepolation of an object.</p>
<p>Using easings will make your storyboard looks smoother and more appealing, but
be careful, easings are also needed to be used properly. What I mean is that a
bad combination of easings can decrease the visual quality of a map, so be
careful to choose wisely your easings! Here's few good examples I made myself:</p>
<center>
<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/657117578464067619/657118638553169921/XcYJKl2.gif"/>

</center>
<p>In these examples, I've used different easings, and even used multiples for some
of these. So what are you waiting for to implement these really cool things into
your next storyboard? :)</p>
<h3 id="animations"><a class="header" href="#animations">Animations</a></h3>
<hr />
<p>Let's get back into sprite management process, I've probably told you in my
last chapter, that there are two types of objects storyboards can handle. The
first one is the basic sprite object which is just a static image rendered. The
second one is the <strong>Animation</strong> object. It's a series of sprites combined
together to make a single animation sprite that shows every sprites with some
delay between them. It kinda works like a gif.</p>
<p>This is not really complicated to setup, but osu! doesn't really explain it
properly so here's my take on it. Grab one of your favourite gif, load it to
that website: <a href="https://ezgif.com/split">ezgifs.com/split</a>. Once there, you can
split up your gif into multiple images, I recommend you using a short gif for
that tutorial, it's gonna be easier to manage (10-15 sprites is fine). Once
you've downloaded all of the images, put them in a new folder of your beatmap.
Something like <strong>sb/animation</strong> is good. Finally rename every sprite with a
common name that end with a number at the end, your folder might look like
that:</p>
<pre><code>sb/animation/my_sprite0.jpg
sb/animation/my_sprite1.jpg
sb/animation/my_sprite2.jpg
sb/animation/my_sprite3.jpg
...
sb/animation/my_sprite15.jpg
</code></pre>
<p>If you then, open up your editor and try to add a new sprite from the library,
you should see your animation running directly into the library, click on it to
import it, add 2 movements keyframes to make it appear long enough, and there
you go, your gif is now running on osu! cool right? If you want to tweak the
speed playing time of your animation, you have to change the .osb file line of
the animation to fit your needs</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">[ Animation | Foreground | Centre | &quot;sb\animation\s.jpg&quot; | 320 | 240 |        8         |            78            | LoopForever ]
[    Type   |    Layer   | Origin |         Path         |  x  |  y  | number_of_images | delay_between_images[ms] |  loop_type  ]
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, animations objects inherits from a Sprite, so you can use the same
parameters for an Animation that you would use for a sprite, think of it, it's
just a Sprite, that is animated. Nothing else.</p>
<h3 id="additive-rendering"><a class="header" href="#additive-rendering">Additive rendering</a></h3>
<hr />
<p>An advanced concept which can be kind of daunting to understand is the layer
blending. osu! works with 2 layer blending techniques methods, the basic
rendering process, simply take the nearest sprite and render it pixels, and
nothing else, so if you place a sprite in front of another it's gonna simply
show it on top of it without changing anything to these 2 sprites. But what the
<strong>additive blend mode</strong> does is that it kind of make an &quot;addition&quot; each white
values pixel color.</p>
<p>Here is an application of that concept in a storyboard:</p>
<center>
<img src="https://media1.giphy.com/media/C9QuyaLQxMd52aLIM1/giphy.gif" />
</center>
<p>You can notice that the light looks very bright and sort of &quot;blend&quot; the images
together to give a sort of halo effect. The additive blending mode can be
really useful to achieve a proper blend of your sprites. It can be also used to
remove the black pixels of a jpg image. Because in additive black pixels are
transparent. If you are more interested in that technique, I recommend you
reading this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_color">wikipedia article</a>
about how the additive color work.</p>
<h3 id="loops"><a class="header" href="#loops">Loops</a></h3>
<hr />
<p>Last but not least, and probably the more complex is the OsbLoop. A way to make
some parameters repeat over a time duration, this is a difficult concept to
understand because it can be missleading.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not think that an OsbLoop allows you to generate lot of sprites and
complex things because it is not really what you think.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is what I would said to anyone being introduced to osb loops, because what it
just does is repeating a specific pool of parameters for a <strong>given</strong> sprite.
Take for example a quick blink effect for an image, you want it to make it
quickly apear and disapear each 100 milliseconds. Here a visualization of the
effect:</p>
<pre><code>Fade from 1 to 0 at 0ms to 100ms
Fade from 1 to 0 at 100ms to 200ms
Fade from 1 to 0 at 200ms to 300ms
Fade from 1 to 0 at 300ms to 400ms
...
</code></pre>
<p>In an osb file this would look like that:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">Sprite,Background,Centre,&quot;sprite.jpg&quot;,320,240
_F,0,0,100,1,0
_F,0,100,200,1,0
_F,0,200,300,1,0
_F,0,300,400,1,0
... etc
</code></pre>
<p>This might be perfectly fine, it's just a bunch of copy/paste and there you go.
But it's not, for multiple reasons, first, imagine that you want to do 100
blinks. Are you really gonna copy paste 100 lines of code to achieve what you
want?</p>
<p>This is where OsbLoop take place, it allow you in few lines of code to repeat
actions for a sprite. Think of the process like that:</p>
<pre><code>Create my sprite,
 Create a loop and repeat it 100 times
  In that loop Fade from 0 to 100 ms
</code></pre>
<p>So we're gonna condense 100 lines into only 2, which is pretty insane right?
Let's test this out, here's the implementation on a storyboard of what we said
earlier:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">[Events]
//Background and Video events
//Storyboard Layer 0 (Background)
//Storyboard Layer 1 (Fail)
//Storyboard Layer 2 (Pass)
//Storyboard Layer 3 (Foreground)
Sprite,Foreground,Centre,&quot;bg.jpg&quot;,320,240
 L,0,100
  F,0,0,100,1,0
//Storyboard Layer 4 (Overlay)
//Storyboard Sound Samples
</code></pre>
<p>We create a simple sprite object, then give it the L parameter which is a Loop,
the first value of it is the &quot;Start Time&quot; and the second one is the number of
time it gonna repeat. So our loop is starting at 0ms of the beatmap and loop
100 times</p>
<p>The second line is just a <code>Fade</code> parameter, but here it becomes kinda
complicated. The start and end value are 0 and 100, why? That is because <strong>any
parameters</strong> in a loop, their start time depends on the <strong>loop's start time</strong>
so if our Loop start at 112214ms, any 0 value of a parameter inside it gonna be
112214 exactly. And the second thing to understand is that a <code>Loop</code> will make
another iteration at the time of every parameters inside it is <strong>Done</strong></p>
<p>So if our Loop start at 112214ms, and the fade inside it end at 1000ms, it will
means that the Fade will happen from 112214 to 113214, and THEN repeat from
113214 to 114214 etc etc... until the loop count is reached. I can understand
that this topic can be mindblowing at a first time, but don't worry just do
some tests and you'll easily understand those.</p>
<hr />
<p>This closes our complete overview of the storyboarding concepts, I hope I've
been clear enough to make your understand all the possibilities of
storyboarding, if you have any questions about it, do not hesitate to ask me on
discord, or just write a post in the Storyboarding subforum of osu!. I'm
always happy to help new people getting used to storyboarding!</p>
<p>In the next chapter I'm gonna talk about optimizations techniques, which are
also an important topic in storyboarding.</p>
