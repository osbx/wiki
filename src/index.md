# osbx wiki

Welcome to the osbx wiki!

In this wiki, you will find plenty of resources to learn about the featured
tool `osbx`. If you are not yet comfortable with the `.osb` file format,
there is also documentation about storyboarding in general. You can find
everything you need on the left sidebar.

**Warning**: This wiki is still work in progress, if you're
