# Getting started

Let's get started on your osbx journey! In this category, we'll talk about
`osbx`.

We will learn how to set up a workspace and how you can use this tool. You
will also learn about the concept of components and plugins and understand
how they work together to make your storyboard scalable. Finally, we will
help you create your very first plugin using osbx and see how you can join
the community and collaborate!
